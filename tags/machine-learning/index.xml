      <description>LibTLDA is a library of classifiers designed for domain adaptation and transfer learning, available in Matlab and Python. It started out as the collection of classifiers that I implemented during my PhD, but is now being expanded with more methods and algorithms.
Installation has been made easy, and there are demos to help you get started. Coders familiar with sci-kit will find it easy to employ.
More information is available on its github page and its documentation page.</description>
