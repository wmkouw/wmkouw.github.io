      <title>Sequential domain-adaptive machine learning</title>

      <description>This poster recaps two collaboration projects I did during my time as Niels Stensen Fellow at the University of Copenhagen. The main point of my proposal was to study &amp;ldquo;sequential domain adaptation&amp;rdquo;. The left column describes an application to &amp;ldquo;spatial sequences&amp;rdquo;, i.e., multi-site biomedical imaging, and the right column describes an application to &amp;ldquo;temporal sequences&amp;rdquo;, i.e. natural language processing over data collected in snapshots over time. The main take-home message from the work in this Fellowship is that domain adaptation is a solution to training machine learning models under sampling bias and that sequential adaptation allows for updating.</description>

      <description>ICT.OPEN is the Dutch national conference for computer science in general. Researchers from various universities and companies present their work along different tracks.
I presented my work in the Machine Learning track. My topic was cross-validation under covariate shift and how to reduce variance in the importance-weighted risk estimator.</description>

      <description>NVPHBV is the Dutch Society for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing. During their meetings, researchers from the Netherlands have a chance to present some of their work and catch up on developments in their fields.
I presented my work on a robust estimator for linear discriminant analysis in domain-adaptive machine learning.</description>

      <description>SNN organized a one day symposium entitled Intelligent Machines, where an overview of recent developments was presented. The meeting aimed to establish a dialogue and to build connections between academic research, industry and public institutions in the Netherlands.
I presented my preliminary work on incorporating transfer models in domain-adaptive classifiers.</description>
