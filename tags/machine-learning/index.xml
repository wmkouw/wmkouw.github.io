      <description>LibTLDA is a library of classifiers designed for domain adaptation and transfer learning, available in Matlab and Python. It started out as the collection of classifiers that I implemented during my PhD, but is now being expanded with more methods and algorithms.
Installation has been made easy, and there are demos to help you get started. Coders familiar with sci-kit will find it easy to employ.
More information is available on its github page and its documentation page.</description>

      <description>My first project at the Netherlands eScience Center was with the winner of the Young eScientist Award 2016, dr. Maureen van Eijnatten. She worked at the 3D Innovation Lab under the department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery at the Vrije Universiteit medical center (VUmc), together with PhD student Jordi Minnema and medical engineer Niels Liberton.
During the project, we developed a method for automatically detecting bone tissue in medical CT-scanner images. This method consisted of an artificial neural network, called a convolutional neural network (CNN), which looks at individual voxels in the image plus their surroundings.</description>

      <title>Variance reduction techniques for importance-weighted cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/ictopen2017/</link>

      <description>ICT.OPEN is the Dutch national conference for computer science in general. Researchers from various universities and companies present their work along different tracks.
I presented my work in the Machine Learning track. My topic was cross-validation under covariate shift and how to reduce variance in the importance-weighted risk estimator.</description>

      <description>NVPHBV is the Dutch Society for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing. During their meetings, researchers from the Netherlands have a chance to present some of their work and catch up on developments in their fields.
I presented my work on a robust estimator for linear discriminant analysis in domain-adaptive machine learning.</description>
