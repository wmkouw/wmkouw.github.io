      <description>Suppose you have two sets of MR images, that were acquired using different scanners and/or different scanning protocols. One set of images is brighter and shows more tissue contrast than the other. One of them has annotations and the other does not. Tissue classifiers &amp;ndash; important to computer-aided diagnosis systems &amp;ndash; can be trained on the annotated data from one scanner, but when applied to data from the other scanner they will drastically under-perform.</description>
