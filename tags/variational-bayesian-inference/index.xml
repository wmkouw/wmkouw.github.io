      <description>This is a talk for the Optimization / Machine Learning Competence group at Sioux Technologies. I presented the probabilistic derivations for the Kalman filter, how to extend those to variational Bayesian filters and some of BIASlab&amp;rsquo;s work on signal processing systems.</description>

      <title>Schedule-free variational message passing for Bayesian filtering</title>

      <description>In Bayesian filtering, states and parameters of probabilistic state-space models are inferred in an online manner. Using the Free Energy Principle, the state-space model is cast to a generative model p and the posterior distributions of interest are approximated using recognition distributions or beliefs q. The factorisation of state-space models into state transitions and observation likelihoods over time supports forming a factor graph and performing inference via message passing.
Tools for message passing on factor graphs typically employ a scheduling procedure, in which a separate algorithm or compiler takes the model description and returns which nodes should pass messages where at what time.</description>
