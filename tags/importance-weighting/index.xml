      <description>During my PhD, I got interested in the question:
&amp;ldquo;How should you do cross-validation when facing shifts in your covariates and you have no labels for your target data?&amp;rdquo;
Sugiyama&amp;rsquo;s group has worked on this question extensively, and proposes a technique called &amp;ldquo;importance-weighted cross-validation&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used this estimator before, but found that it behaves unusually in certain cases. That led me to start investigating the difference between the importance-weighted source risk estimator and the target risk estimator in greater detail.</description>

      <description>ICT.OPEN is the Dutch national conference for computer science in general. Researchers from various universities and companies present their work along different tracks.
I presented my work in the Machine Learning track. My topic was cross-validation under covariate shift and how to reduce variance in the importance-weighted risk estimator.</description>
