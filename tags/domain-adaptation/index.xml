      <description>LibTLDA is a library of classifiers designed for domain adaptation and transfer learning, available in Matlab and Python. It started out as the collection of classifiers that I implemented during my PhD, but is now being expanded with more methods and algorithms.
Installation has been made easy, and there are demos to help you get started. Coders familiar with sci-kit will find it easy to employ.
More information is available on its github page and its documentation page.</description>

      <description>NVPHBV is the Dutch Society for Pattern Recognition and Image Processing. During their meetings, researchers from the Netherlands have a chance to present some of their work and catch up on developments in their fields.
I presented my work on a robust estimator for linear discriminant analysis in domain-adaptive machine learning.</description>
