      <title>Cross-center smoothness prior for Bayesian image segmentation</title>

      <description>A simple idea: learn how smooth medical image segmentations are supposed to look like and use this knowledge as a prior for Bayesian image segmentation. That way, you avoid learning a different mapping from scan to segmentation for each scanner while still learning from data at other medical centers.</description>

      <title>MR Acquisition-invariant representation learning</title>

      <description>This conference poster refers back to the project on accounting for variation in medical images due to MR acquisition protocol. Acquisition variation is caused by different vendors, mechanical calibrations and environmental effects at different medical centers, and hamper generalization of medical image processing techniques that employ machine learning.</description>
