      <description>While I was at the Netherlands eScience Center, I worked on the Young eScientist Award 2016 project, together with its winner Maureen van Eijnatten and PhD student Jordi Minnema. They&amp;rsquo;re part of the 3D Innovation Lab under the department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery at the Vrije Universiteit medical center.
During the project, we developed a method for automatically detecting bone tissue in medical CT-scanner images. This method consisted of an artificial neural network, called a convolutional neural network (CNN), which looks at individual voxels in the image plus their surroundings.</description>
