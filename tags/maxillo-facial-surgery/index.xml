      <description>My first project at the Netherlands eScience Center was with the winner of the Young eScientist Award 2016, dr. Maureen van Eijnatten. She worked at the 3D Innovation Lab under the department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery at the Vrije Universiteit medical center (VUmc), together with PhD student Jordi Minnema and medical engineer Niels Liberton.
During the project, we developed a method for automatically detecting bone tissue in medical CT-scanner images. This method consisted of an artificial neural network, called a convolutional neural network (CNN), which looks at individual voxels in the image plus their surroundings.</description>
