The International Labour Organisation reports over 300 million work-related accidents and diseases per year, with nearly 3 million being fatal (ILO report). Embodied Artificially Intelligent (EAI) agents can reduce this drastically, by for example inspecting construction sites or transporting cargo through hazardous areas. However, autonomously navigating unknown environments is difficult and requires adaptive decision-making. Suppose the agent detects a visually ambiguous obstacle: is it a crate that can be pushed away? Or a fence that needs to be navigated around? Rule-based algorithms and task-priority controllers could yield unsafe situations, while reinforcement learning (RL) requires enormous amounts of trial-and-error, potentially breaking the robot during training. The challenge is to design an EAI agent that cautiously and efficiently explores using multiple sensory modalities to find the best path through unknown terrain.\nFigure 1. Upon detection of an obstacle, external uncertainty (vision) increases. This uncertainty will be transferred to internal uncertainty (kinematic). The agent then minimizes kinematic uncertainty by making contact with the obstacle. Solution framework: brain-inspired multi-modal switching dynamics. We believe an agent should use touch for exploration when vision cannot resolve ambiguity in its environment (Figure 1). Mechanically, we envision an agent that transfers visual uncertainty about the external world (what is this obstacle in front of me?) to kinematic uncertainty internally (what will happen if I move my leg?), and then reacts with actions that minimize uncertainty (e.g., gently push object with leg). To create such an agent, we take inspiration from natural embodied intelligence and computational neuroscience, specifically Active Inference. An active inference agent operates on beliefs (probability distributions over unknown variables) and updates these using variational Bayesian inference when new data is observed. Using quantified uncertainty, actions are balanced between exploration (maximizing information gain during data acquisition) and exploitation (reaching a goal). It has been demonstrated to be a powerful framework for planning and navigation. Uncertainty also leads to caution: slow careful movements when uncertainty is high and rapid targeted movements when uncertainty is low.\nWe propose to design an active inference agent for a quadrupedal robot that incorporates visual perception, planning, decision-making and sensorimotor control (Figure 2). The active inference module learns two sets of dynamics: loco-motion and loco-manipulation. Visual perception is passed as a belief, expressed in terms of a factorized probability distribution, to the active inference module. Visual uncertainty is merged with the uncertainty in the loco-manipulation dynamics, akin to sensor fusion. When that uncertainty becomes large, the agent favours actions that minimize it in the future, such as manipulating the unknown object with its leg. Since the initial uncertainty will be high, the agent will make contact cautiously. Uncertainty shrinks with contact and a stronger action, such as pushing the object away, will be chosen, leading to a potentially improved locomotion path. In summary, the proposed active inference agent will use multiple modalities (vision, touch) to cautiously resolve ambiguity in the world and navigate the environment more robustly.\nFigure 2. Active inference agent overview. Vision-based uncertainty about the world affects kinematic uncertainty and triggers a switch to loco-manipulation, exploring the world through cautious touch. Planning implemented as message passing on a Forney-style factor graph (edges are random variables, nodes are operations) of switching autoregressive models. Implementation. The agent will have a vision, a control and a decision-making module (Figure 2). The vision module runs a simultaneous localization and mapping algorithm as well as rudimentary object detection. The planning and navigation module will switch between locomotion and loco-manipulation. During locomotion, it generates targets for a gait controller and guides the robot along the planned path. During loco-manipulation, it plans a series of cautious contact-rich policies that maximize information gain on the object and whether it can be pushed away. We will use switching autoregressive models, that are explainable in terms of the effect of input sources on output prediction, and for which information gain can be calculated analytically. Computations are distributed by means of reactive message passing on a Forney-style factor graph. This ensures computation cost is small enough to run in-situ (e.g., Raspberry Pi + NVIDIA Jetson) on a low-cost quadrupedal robot platform (e.g., Petoi Bittle), which we aim to demonstrate as proof-of-concept.\n","date":1734652800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1734652800,"objectID":"fbe98d1668b3da8efb1885a1722327d8","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/project/contact-ai/","publishdate":"2024-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/contact-ai/","section":"project","summary":"CONTACT-AI aims to transform legged robots into contact-rich explorers, where legs are used to walk but also to cautiously manipulate the environment to resolve ambiguities in visual perception and navigate unknown terrain.","tags":["active-inference","quadrupedal-robot","embodied-ai"],"title":"CONTACT-AI","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chengfeng Jia","Jie Ma","Wouter M.

There are many technical challenges, such as how to account for strong non-linearities, how to deal with high degrees of freedom of moving parts or how to include practical constraints to avoid breaking hardware.\nWhy Active Inference? It represents a series of technical advantages over the current state-of-the-art in AI methodologies. Deep learning is a popular framework with impressive applications, but is not without its limitations. Firstly, it requires huge amounts of data to “discover” structure. AIF is a hybrid of model-driven and data-driven learning, which means it can rely on prior knowledge when data is scarce. Crucially, deep learning methods only perform well after an experienced designer has extensively tuned the network’s architecture, regularized its complexity and tried various optimizers. In AIF, there are fewer model parameters, regularization arises naturally through prior distributions and optimization is not an issue. To train deep neural networks, you need expensive hardware (GPU) with a sizeable carbon footprint. AIF agents require less computation power and are more suited to embedded electronics. Last but not least, when deep learning is applied to control (deep reinforcement learning), the engineer must design a “reward function” that indicates the value of actions. This function is hard to design, leading to misbehaving agents. AIF agents do not suffer from this problem because rewards arise implicitly from the probabilistic model. These properties are all nice, but the most important argument for AIF is that it represents a principled way to design intelligent systems: instead of hacking something together based on task-specific cost functions, we now have a first-principle-based framework of perception, decision-making, planning and action.\nWhy quadrupedal walking robots? Because unlike wheeled robots, walkers can step over objects and climb stairs. Unlike drones, they can enter confined spaces and operate for extended periods of time. In theory, quadrupeds are highly agile. In practice, learning to walk is such a complex challenge that they often fail to live up to their potential. Modern AI has accelerated legged robotics to the point that quadrupeds now walk relatively smoothly. Companies such as Boston Dynamics, ANYbotics and Unitree are developing commercial products for semi-autonomous site inspection and maintenance. But their controllers still rely heavily on deep learning. Our AIF agent will make it much easier to teach legged robots to walk.\nHow will the proposed agent work? AIF agents are based on a probabilistic graphical model expressing the dependence of observed and unknown variables through conditional distributions. For dynamical systems, there are leaf nodes representing initial conditions that are specified as “prior beliefs”. One can estimate the posterior distributions for the unknowns (e.g. states, parameters, noises) through Bayesian inference, usually in the form of a message-passing algorithm. Sometimes, the integrals involved are intractable. Variational inference solves this by approximating the posteriors with a simpler “recognition model”. AIF agents are essentially a form of variational Bayesian inference on probabilistic graphical models of dynamic systems that alternate between solving a signal processing (perception) and a control (action) problem to reach a goal.\nThe position is supported by the Sectorplan Techniek of the Dutch Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Eindhoven Artificial Intelligence Systems Institute.\n","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"61c7b5b20c279d2d7bedecbff1a75a59","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/project/fep-quad/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fep-quad/","section":"project","summary":"Design of an intelligent autonomous system for quadrupedal robot locomotion using Active Inference (AIF).

In this paper we show that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimisation, a core feature of the framework, does not lead to purposeful explorative behaviour in linear Gaussian dynamical systems. We provide a simple proof that, due to the specific construction used for the EFE, the terms responsible for the exploratory (epistemic) drive become constant in the case of linear Gaussian systems. This renders AIF equivalent to KL control. From a theoretical point of view this is an interesting result since it is generally assumed that EFE minimisation will always introduce an exploratory drive in AIF agents. While the full EFE objective does not lead to exploration in linear Gaussian dynamical systems, the principles of its construction can still be used to design objectives that include an epistemic drive. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanics behind the epistemic drive of AIF agents and show how to design objectives for linear Gaussian dynamical systems that do include an epistemic drive. Concretely, we show that focusing solely on epistemics and dispensing with goal-directed terms leads to a form of maximum entropy exploration that is heavily dependent on the type of control signals driving the system. Additive controls do not permit such exploration. From a practical point of view this is an important result since linear Gaussian dynamical systems with additive controls are an extensively used model class, encompassing for instance Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. On the other hand, linear Gaussian dynamical systems driven by multiplicative controls such as switching transition matrices do permit an exploratory drive.","tags":[],"title":"On epistemics in expected free energy for linear Gaussian state space models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Albert Podusenko","Wouter M.

It is often unknown in advance how an algorithm will perform on new unseen data, being a crucial reason for not deploying an algorithm at all. Therefore, tools are needed to measure the similarity of data sets. In this paper, we propose the Data Representativeness Criterion (DRC) to determine how representative a training data set is of a new unseen data set. We present a proof of principle, to see whether the DRC can quantify the similarity of data sets and whether the DRC relates to the performance of a supervised classification algorithm. We compared a number of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets, ranging from subtle to severe difference is acquisition parameters. Results indicate that, based on the similarity of data sets, the DRC is able to give an indication as to when the performance of a supervised classifier decreases.

The aim of the present study was to develop and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for bone segmentation in computed tomography (CT) scans. METHODS: The CNN was trained with CT scans acquired using six different scanners. Standard tessellation language (STL) models of 20 patients who had previously undergone craniotomy and cranioplasty using additively manufactured skull implants served as 'gold standard' models during CNN training. The CNN segmented all patient CT scans using a leave-2-out cross-validation scheme. All segmented CT scans were converted into STL models and geometrically compared with the gold standard STL models. RESULTS: The CT scans segmented using the CNN demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentation and resulted in a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92 (0.04). The CNN-based STL models demonstrated mean surface deviations ranging between -0.19 (0.86) mm and 1.22 (1.75) mm, when compared to the gold standard STL models. No major differences were observed between the mean deviations of the CNN-based STL models acquired using six different CT scanners. CONCLUSIONS: The fully-automated CNN was able to accurately segment the skull. CNNs thus offer the opportunity of removing the current prohibitive barriers of time and effort during CT image segmentation, making patient-specific AM constructs more accessible.","tags":[],"title":"CT image segmentation of bone for medical additive manufacturing using a CNN","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536397200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536397200,"objectID":"7aac80f8e6b3d242d3cf6f8b90e25ab7","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/big-data-trust/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/big-data-trust/","section":"event","summary":"Research institutions, hospitals, governments and companies are collecting all kinds of data at an increased rate. Such “big data” offers the possibility to increase our understanding of human behavior, improve clinical diagnosis, and create intelligent consumer products. However, data can also end up in the hands of parties that may take advantage of you. For example, Facebook user data was leaked to political campaigners to influence voters [1]. Central to this debate is the concept of trust: how can you trust that the data that you give out will not end up hurting you?\nThis debate was recently sparked by the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals in the EU the right to review and destroy personal data collected by third parties. The GDPR greatly complicates the collection and dissemination of research data, particularly in medical sciences. How should researchers analyze data and publish their findings if their subjects decide that their data is to remain private? Can patient data be fully anonymized and yet remain traceable at the same time?  And how does data protection and privacy fit within the principle of open science that encourages researchers to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)?\nAn interesting novel technology in the data and trust debate is blockchain. The goal is to create a distributed transaction system without a central authority that profits from this position, for example the exchange of money without the intervention of a bank. Individual users can issue transactions that are subsequently verified by the entire community through a blockchain. If there’s foul play, for instance by someone changing their own balance, the transaction is rejected by the community. Blockchain thus ensures consensus between users that do not trust each other, which makes the technology interesting for a wide range of applications.\nIn this workshop, we will present different views on how big data is currently being used. Furthermore, we will initiate an interactive discussion with the audience during which the participants can answer questions and share opinions using their smartphones.","tags":["big-data","GDPR"],"title":"Big data \u0026 trust","type":"event"},{"authors":["Wouter M.

If it is not an accurate reﬂection of the population, then the system will not perform well. In particular, if the collected data is biased, which means that one observes certain examples more often than normal, then the system can be misled into thinking that certain outcomes are also more likely to occur. Although the system might make accurate diagnoses for new patients arriving to that particular hospital, it will make inaccurate diagnoses for patients arriving to 1a diﬀerent hospital. The diﬀerences between patient populations might be due to regional diﬀerences such as exercise culture, but the fact that one observes for instance older patients more than normal means that data collected from that hospital is biased with respect to the total human population.\nHandling biased samples from populations is a problem that has long been studied in statistics and econometrics. Although a number of techniques have been proposed to improve supervised learning systems trained on biased data, things have changed with the tremendous increase in computational power in the last 20 years. The ﬁeld has advanced to the point where we ask the question whether it is possible to generalize to particular target populations as well. Can we adapt a supervised learning system trained on adult human heart disease patients to make accurate decisions for infant heart disease patients?\nWork from the last 10 years has looked at incorporating unlabeled data from these target populations. With this additional information, systems can recognize changes in data properties, ﬁnd correspondences between populations and adapt their decisions accordingly. Successful adaptation is deﬁned as an improvement over the performance of the original system. Nonetheless, the analysis of this problem is not complete, and it is not clear which conditions have to be fulﬁlled in order for the system to perform well. It seems that in cases where it is diﬃcult to describe how two populations relate to each other, adaptive systems suﬀer from high variability. They are highly uncertain about their decisions and often wrong. However, it seems that the more similar the populations are, the likelier it is that the system adapts well. It would, for example, be easier for the system to adapt to predict heart disease in adolescents based on data from adults, then it would for the system to adapt to infants. However, here might lie a potentially crucial insight: can we design a system that ﬁrst adapts to the closest population and only then adapts to the ﬁnal target population? In other words, a system that sequentially adapts?\nThis position is supported by a Niels Stensen Fellowship grant, offered by the Niels Stensen Stichting.\n","date":1527811200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527811200,"objectID":"cf6989131917c8deb50651bc41059b38","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/project/seqdais/","publishdate":"2018-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/seqdais/","section":"project","summary":"Sequential Domain Adaptive Intelligent Systems focuses on domain-adaptative classification over an ordered sequence of biased samples.

Following that, I discuss three common simple data set shifts, namely prior, covariate and concept shift. For more complex domain shifts, there are a wide variety of approaches. These are categorized into: importance-weighting, subspace mapping, domain-invariant projections, feature augmentation, minimax estimators and robust algorithms. A number of points will arise, which I will discuss in the last section.

Tasks such as autonomous driving, recognizing tumors in medical images, or detecting suspicious packages in airports. Such systems learn by observing examples, i.e. data, and forming a mathematical description of what types of variations occur, i.e. a statistical model. For new input, the system computes the most likely output and makes a decision accordingly. As a scientific field, it is situated between statistics and and algorithmics. As a technology, it has become a very powerful tool due to the massive amounts of data being collected and the drop in the cost of computation.\nHowever, obtaining enough data is still very difficult. There are often substantial financial, operational or ethical considerations in collecting data. The majority of research in machine learning deals with constraints on the amount, the labeling and the types of data that are available. One such constraint is that it is only possible to collect labeled data from one population, or domain, but the goal is to make decisions for another domain. It is unclear under which conditions this will be possible, which inspires the research question: when and how can a classification algorithm generalize from a source domain to a target domain?\nMy research has looked at different approaches to domain adaptation. Firstly, we have asked some critical questions on whether the standard approaches to model validation still hold in the context of different domains. As a result, we have proposed a means to reduce uncertainty in the validation risk estimator, but that does not solve the problem completely. Secondly, we modeled the transfer from source to target domain using parametric families of distributions, which works well in simple contexts such as feature dropout at test time. Thirdly, we looked at a more practical problem: tissue classifiers trained on data from one MRI scanner degrade when applied to data from another scanner due to acquisition-based variations. We tackled this problem by learning a representation for which detrimental variations are minimized while maintaining tissue contrast. Finally, considering that many approaches fail in practice because their assumptions are not met, we designed a parameter estimator that never performs worse than the naive non-adaptive classifier.\n","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"6c5f0a78251ba78a7e451df82624aed0","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/project/dapr/","publishdate":"2014-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/dapr/","section":"project","summary":"Domain Adaptive Pattern Recognition explores the limits of generalization for a special case of statistical learning where training data and test data are differently biased samples of some underlying data-generating distribution.","tags":["domain-adaptation","transfer-learning","machine-learning","pattern-recognition"],"title":"DAPR","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"page"}]
