The aim of the present study was to develop and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for bone segmentation in computed tomography (CT) scans. METHODS: The CNN was trained with CT scans acquired using six different scanners. Standard tessellation language (STL) models of 20 patients who had previously undergone craniotomy and cranioplasty using additively manufactured skull implants served as “gold standard” models during CNN training. The CNN segmented all patient CT scans using a leave-2-out cross-validation scheme. All segmented CT scans were converted into STL models and geometrically compared with the gold standard STL models. RESULTS: The CT scans segmented using the CNN demonstrated a large overlap with the gold standard segmentation and resulted in a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.92 ± 0.04. The CNN-based STL models demonstrated mean surface deviations ranging between -0.19 mm ± 0.86 mm and 1.22 mm ± 1.75 mm, when compared to the gold standard STL models. No major differences were observed between the mean deviations of the CNN-based STL models acquired using six different CT scanners. CONCLUSIONS: The fully-automated CNN was able to accurately segment the skull. CNNs thus offer the opportunity of removing the current prohibitive barriers of time and effort during CT image segmentation, making patient-specific AM constructs more accesible.","tags":["medical-imaging","computed-tomography","deep-learning","additive manufacturing"],"title":"CT image segmentation of bone for medical additive manufacturing using a CNN","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Research institutions, hospitals, governments and companies are collecting all kinds of data at an increased rate.

Central to this debate is the concept of trust: how can you trust that the data that you give out will not end up hurting you?\nThis debate was recently sparked by the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals in the EU the right to review and destroy personal data collected by third parties. The GDPR greatly complicates the collection and dissemination of research data, particularly in medical sciences. How should researchers analyze data and publish their findings if their subjects decide that their data is to remain private? Can patient data be fully anonymized and yet remain traceable at the same time? And how does data protection and privacy fit within the principle of open science that encourages researchers to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)?\nAn interesting novel technology in the data and trust debate is blockchain. The goal is to create a distributed transaction system without a central authority that profits from this position, for example the exchange of money without the intervention of a bank. Individual users can issue transactions that are subsequently verified by the entire community through a blockchain. If there’s foul play, for instance by someone changing their own balance, the transaction is rejected by the community. Blockchain thus ensures consensus between users that do not trust each other, which makes the technology interesting for a wide range of applications.\nIn this workshop, we will present different views on how big data is currently being used. Furthermore, we will initiate an interactive discussion with the audience during which the participants can answer questions and share opinions using their smartphones.\n[1] https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\n","date":1536405486,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536405486,"objectID":"f54be9f9cacfa086dabea59e675e1470","permalink":"https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/nsfworkshop-bigdata/","publishdate":"2018-09-08T13:18:06+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/nsfworkshop-bigdata/","section":"talk","summary":"Research institutions, hospitals, governments and companies are collecting all kinds of data at an increased rate.

If the classifier's assumptions on the relationship between domains (e.g. covariate shift) are valid, then it will usually outperform a non-adaptive source classifier. Unfortunately, it can perform substantially worse when its assumptions are invalid. Validating these assumptions requires labeled target samples, which are usually not available. We argue that, in order to make domain-adaptive classifiers more practical, it is necessary to focus on robust methods; robust in the sense that the model still achieves a particular level of performance without making strong assumptions on the relationship between domains. With this objective in mind, we formulate a conservative parameter estimator that only deviates from the source classifier when a lower or equal risk is guaranteed for all possible labellings of the given target samples. We derive the corresponding estimator for a discriminant analysis model, and show that its risk is actually strictly smaller than that of the source classifier. Experiments indicate that our classifier outperforms state-of-the-art classifiers for geographically biased samples.
