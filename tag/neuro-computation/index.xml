      <description>&lt;p&gt;Computation in biological brain tissue consumes several orders of magnitude less power than silicon-based systems. Motivated by this fact, this project aims to develop the world’s first hybrid neuro-in-silico Artificial Intelligence (AI) computer, introducing a fundamentally new paradigm of AI computing. In this high-risk high-gain project, we will combine an in-silico Bayesian control agent (BCA) with neural tissue hosted by a microfluidic Brain-on-Chip (BoC) that together form a hybrid learning system capable of solving real-world AI problems. Toward this paradigm, all computation and communication inside and between the BCA and BoC will be governed by the Free Energy Principle, which is both the leading neuroscientific theory for describing biological neuronal processes and supports a variational Bayesian machine learning interpretation. We will start by developing a pure silicon-based BCA that learns to balance an inverted pendulum, implemented by free energy minimization on a factor graph. Next, we will replace successively larger parts of the factor graph with biological neural circuits of a microfluidic multi-compartment BoC device. The biological network will be trained by electrical stimulation orchestrated by the synthetic Bayesian agent. For the communication between these two units, we will design and realize a novel communication protocol making use of existing software being applied in readout and event sorting for Calcium imaging and multi-electrode array data, such as MEAViewer, CALIMA, NetCal and SpikeHunter. By upscaling the number of replaced sub-circuits, we aim to provide a proof-of-concept and to lay the basis for ultra-low power hybrid brain-on-chip AI computing. Taking on this challenge, BayesBrain aligns with multiple EAISI program lines, in particular “Computational AI Hardware and Software” and “Merging Models and Data in AI.”&lt;/p&gt;
