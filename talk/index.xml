      <title>Sequential domain-adaptive machine learning</title>

      <description>This poster recaps two collaboration projects I did during my time as Niels Stensen Fellow at the University of Copenhagen. The main point of my proposal was to study &amp;ldquo;sequential domain adaptation&amp;rdquo;. The left column describes an application to &amp;ldquo;spatial sequences&amp;rdquo;, i.e., multi-site biomedical imaging, and the right column describes an application to &amp;ldquo;temporal sequences&amp;rdquo;, i.e. natural language processing over data collected in snapshots over time. The main take-home message from the work in this Fellowship is that domain adaptation is a solution to training machine learning models under sampling bias and that sequential adaptation allows for updating.</description>

      <title>Cross-center smoothness prior for Bayesian image segmentation</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/ipmi2019/</link>

      <description>A simple idea: learn how smooth medical image segmentations are supposed to look like and use this knowledge as a prior for Bayesian image segmentation. That way, you avoid learning a different mapping from scan to segmentation for each scanner while still learning from data at other medical centers.</description>

      <title>MR Acquisition-invariant representation learning</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/isbi2019/</link>

      <description>This conference poster refers back to the project on accounting for variation in medical images due to MR acquisition protocol. Acquisition variation is caused by different vendors, mechanical calibrations and environmental effects at different medical centers, and hamper generalization of medical image processing techniques that employ machine learning.</description>

      <title>Big data &amp; trust</title>

      <description>Research institutions, hospitals, governments and companies are collecting all kinds of data at an increased rate. Such “big data” offers the possibility to increase our understanding of human behavior, improve clinical diagnosis, and create intelligent consumer products. However, data can also end up in the hands of parties that may take advantage of you. For example, Facebook user data was leaked to political campaigners to influence voters [1]. Central to this debate is the concept of trust: how can you trust that the data that you give out will not end up hurting you?</description>

      <title>Effects of sampling skewness in importance-weighted cross-validation</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/icpr2018/</link>

      <description>I presented my paper on how the importance-weighted risk estimator&amp;rsquo;s sampling distribution is skewed for small sample sizes. The weights effectively ensure an under- or over-estimation of risk, depending on whether the source distribution has larger or smaller variance than the target distribution, respectively. I explore how this affects hyperparameter selection during importance-weighted cross-validation.</description>

      <description>ICT.OPEN is the Dutch national conference for computer science in general. Researchers from various universities and companies present their work along different tracks.
I presented my work in the Machine Learning track. My topic was cross-validation under covariate shift and how to reduce variance in the importance-weighted risk estimator.</description>

      <title>On cross-validation under covariate shift</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/talk/icpr2016/</link>

      <description>I presented my paper on problems with importance-weighted cross-validation under covariate shift. Under covariate shift, the standard cross-validation estimator is not consistent (i.e. it won&amp;rsquo;t return optimal hyperparameter estimates). Importance-weighting the cross-validation estimator was deemed to resolve this issue, but we show that it is still not consistent.</description>
