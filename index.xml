      <title>Big data &amp; trust</title>

      <description>&lt;!-- # Data and trust --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research institutions, hospitals, governments and companies are collecting all kinds of data at an increased rate. Such “big data” offers the possibility to increase our understanding of human behavior, improve clinical diagnosis, and create intelligent consumer products. However, data can also end up in the hands of parties that may take advantage of you. For example, Facebook user data was leaked to political campaigners to influence voters [1]. Central to this debate is the concept of trust: how can you trust that the data that you give out will not end up hurting you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This debate was recently sparked by the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which gives individuals in the EU the right to review and destroy personal data collected by third parties. The GDPR greatly complicates the collection and dissemination of research data, particularly in medical sciences. How should researchers analyze data and publish their findings if their subjects decide that their data is to remain private? Can patient data be fully anonymized and yet remain traceable at the same time?  And how does data protection and privacy fit within the principle of open science that encourages researchers to make their data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting novel technology in the data and trust debate is blockchain. The goal is to create a distributed transaction system without a central authority that profits from this position, for example the exchange of money without the intervention of a bank. Individual users can issue transactions that are subsequently verified by the entire community through a blockchain. If there’s foul play, for instance by someone changing their own balance, the transaction is rejected by the community. Blockchain thus ensures consensus between users that do not trust each other, which makes the technology interesting for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will present different views on how big data is currently being used. Furthermore, we will initiate an interactive discussion with the audience during which the participants can answer questions and share opinions using their smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LibTLDA is a library of classifiers designed for domain adaptation and transfer learning, available in Matlab and Python. It started out as the collection of classifiers that I implemented during my PhD, but is now being expanded with more methods and algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Installation has been made easy, and there are demos to help you get started. Coders familiar with sci-kit will find it easy to pick up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information is available on its documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://libtlda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was at the Netherlands eScience Center, I worked on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.esciencecenter.nl/project/3d-printing-of-human-body-parts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Young eScientist Award 2016&lt;/a&gt; project, together with its winner &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cwi.nl/people/maureen-van-eijnatten&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Maureen van Eijnatten&lt;/a&gt; and PhD student &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cwi.nl/people/jordi-minnema&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jordi Minnema&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;rsquo;re part of the 3D Innovation Lab under the department of Maxillo-Facial Surgery at the Vrije Universiteit medical center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the project, we developed a method for automatically detecting bone tissue in medical CT-scanner images. This method consisted of an artificial neural network, called a convolutional neural network (CNN), which looks at individual voxels in the image plus their surroundings. If a voxel shows an intensity value suitable for bone tissue and is surrounded voxels with similar intensity values (noisy signal voxels are often isolated), then the network classifies that voxel as bone. It performs its function for a whole CT-scan, which allows us to automatically reconstruct a 3D model of the skull. This 3D model is later used to design and 3D-print saw templates and other constructs to aid surgeons.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>MRAI-net</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/project/mrainet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have two sets of MR images, that were acquired using different scanners and/or different scanning protocols. One set of images is brighter and shows more tissue contrast than the other. One of them has annotations and the other does not. Tissue classifiers &amp;ndash; important to computer-aided diagnosis systems &amp;ndash; can be trained on the annotated data from one scanner, but when applied to data from the other scanner they will drastically under-perform. It is exactly what makes computer systems so powerful, i.e. looking at minute variations in pixel intensities, that also makes them vulnerable to data set shifts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We developed a method called &lt;em&gt;MR Acquisition-Invariant Neural Network&lt;/em&gt; that aims to learn a representation of patches such that these show minimal variation with respect to the MRI scanner without losing clinically-relevant tissue variation. Once trained, the network extracts acquisition-invariant feature vectors, which can be used for a variety of tasks in medical images later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More information is available on its documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://mrai-net.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;ICT.OPEN is the Dutch national conference for computer science in general. Researchers from various universities and companies present their work along different tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented my work in the Machine Learning track. My topic was cross-validation under covariate shift and how to reduce variance in the importance-weighted risk estimator.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>TCPR</title>
      <link>https://wmkouw.github.io/project/tcpr/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 18:05:01 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wmkouw.github.io/project/tcpr/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In domain adaptation, one is always required to make assumptions on how the two domains relate to each other. However, depending on the domain dissimilarity, these assumptions can be quite strong. Furthermore, they are often hard to support, even with labeled target samples. Unfortunately, when an assumption is invalid, the classifier can adapt itself in ways that are detrimental to performance. Therefore, in practice, it can be hard to predict whether a domain-adaptive classifier will perform well for a given problem setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to design a more robust method, one that makes no assumptions on the relationship between the domains, but is still guaranteed to never perform worse than the naive, non-adaptive classifier. We dubbed our resulting parameter estimator the &lt;em&gt;Target Contrastive Pessimistic Risk&lt;/em&gt; estimator, after the estimator it was inspired on: &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7150421&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maximum Contrastive Pessimistic Likelihood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
