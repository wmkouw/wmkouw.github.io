      <description>I think that with our generative models and our recognition distributions we are building (and testing) assumptions of parameterization and independence. In neuroscience, receptive fields in the retina of the eye have been shown to encode incoming visual signals such that they are as decorrelated as possible. That means it becomes easy to represent signals with a small number of neuron activations in higher layers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_coding#Sparse_coding). This setup is most efficient when incoming signals are already independent of each other (e.</description>

      <description>Intelligent systems are deployed for a wide array of tasks, such as diagnosing patients, recognizing faces or translating texts [1]. They are called &amp;ldquo;intelligent&amp;rdquo; because these machines are not specifically programmed to perform the task. Instead, they learn to do their job from a &amp;ldquo;training set&amp;rdquo; of examples. For example, the system might be told to diagnose heart disease in patients based on biometrics such as age and cholesterol level. These biometrics vary across people and there is no fixed rule to form a diagnosis (e.</description>
